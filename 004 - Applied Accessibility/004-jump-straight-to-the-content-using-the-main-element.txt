<!-- MAIN tag surrounds the main content of the page. Notes:
  1 - There should be only one MAIN tag per page.
  2 - It shouldn't include items that repeat across pages, like
      navigation bars, etc.
  3 - It allows assistive devices like screen readers to navigate
      to main content quickly - so it's good for accessibility.
