<!-- LABEL tag is used to wrap around the text to associate it to a specific control item
    within a form - such as an input field, a radio button, a submit button, etc. 
    When associated, that form item gets selected when the text label is clicked, instead 
    of itself specifically being clicked.
    The form item can be placed within the LABEL tag to tie it to the label text, or the
    FOR attribute of the LABEL tag can be tied to the form item using its ID attribute,
    as seen below:
-->
      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="text" id="email" name="email" placeholder="enter your email" required>
      <input type="submit" name="submit" id="example" value="Submit">
      <hr>
      <!-- Just to demonstrate, the below label is tied to a submit button! -->
      <label for="example">If you click this text, you'll click the Submit button above!!!</label>
