# freeCodeCamp 001 - Responsive Web Design Certification

Contains saved sample code for all completed challenges, with my notes and
additional experimentation with things explained, so I'd see how they work.

The following courses have been completed:

* 001 - Basic HTML and HTML5

Currently working on:
### 004 - Applied Accessibility
