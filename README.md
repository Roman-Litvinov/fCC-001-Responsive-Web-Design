# freeCodeCamp 001 - Responsive Web Design Certification

Contains saved sample code for all completed challenges, with my notes and
additional experimentation with things explained, so I'd see how they work.

The following courses have been completed:

* 001 - Basic HTML and HTML5
* 002 - Basic CSS
* 003 - Applied Visual Design
* 004 - Applied Accessibility
* 005 - Responsive Web Design Principles
* 006 - CSS Flexbox
* 007 - CSS Grid


The following is left (needs to be done to actually get the FCC certificate):

### Responsive Web Design Projects
* Build a Tribute Page
* Build a Survey Form
* Build a Product Landing Page
* Build a Technical Documentation Page
* Build a Personal Portfolio page


Will take care of it as I go along - continuing to JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures Certification now...
